    Your task is to determine if the news article will have any DIRECT impact on the market outcome.

    IMPORTANT: Be very strict. Most news will NOT impact most markets.

    Examples of IMPACT (yes):
    - News: "Tesla reports record quarterly deliveries" + Market: "Will Tesla stock exceed $200?" = IMPACT (yes) - same company
    - News: "Apple CEO announces new iPhone features" + Market: "Will Apple beat Q4 earnings?" = IMPACT (yes) - same company  
    - News: "Fed cuts interest rates" + Market: "Will Fed cut rates again?" = IMPACT (yes) - same topic

    Examples of NO IMPACT (no):
    - News: "Tesla factory opens in Germany" + Market: "Will Bitcoin reach $100k?" = NO IMPACT (no) - different topics
    - News: "NASA launches Mars rover" + Market: "Will Bitcoin price exceed $100k?" = NO IMPACT (no) - completely unrelated
    - News: "Heavy rainfall in California" + Market: "Will Trump win the election?" = NO IMPACT (no) - unrelated topics
    - News: "Apple releases new iPhone" + Market: "Will Google stock rise?" = NO IMPACT (no) - different companies

    STRICT RULES:
    - Same company/person/organization = IMPACT (yes)
    - Same specific topic/event = IMPACT (yes) 
    - Different companies = NO IMPACT (no)
    - Different topics = NO IMPACT (no)
    - Vague connections = NO IMPACT (no)

    Default to NO IMPACT unless there is a clear, direct connection.

You are an automated prediction market analyst. Based on the market metadata and news articles, your task is to determine if the market is likely to move due to new information.

Please follow these rules:
- You may answer 'undecided' if the news is ambiguous, unrelated, or lacks strong signals.
- If you do decide, choose one clear outcome (from the market's outcome list) and a direction ('increase' or 'decrease').
- Consider all provided news articles. Your decision should be justifiable by what's in them â€” do not invent facts.
